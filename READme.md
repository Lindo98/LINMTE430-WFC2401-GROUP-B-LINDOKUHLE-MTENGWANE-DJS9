# Code explanation (index.ts file)

In today's video, we're going to walk through a piece of TypeScript code designed for a property review and management application. We'll break down each section so you can understand how it works and how it interacts with the DOM to display property and review information

First, we have our imports at the top of the file. We're importing enums, interfaces, CSS for styling, and utility functions from other files in our project. These imports help us structure our code better and keep it modular. For example, LoyaltyUser and Permissions are enums that categorize user types and permissions.

Next, we select various DOM elements like .properties, .reviews, .container, the button, and the footer. We'll use these elements to dynamically insert and manipulate our content.

We then define a boolean variable isLoggedIn to track the login status. We also have arrays of reviews and properties, and a user object. Each review and property adheres to our imported interfaces, ensuring consistency in our data.

Now, we use the showReviewTotal and populateUser functions to update the DOM with the review totals and user information. This is a good way to keep the code clean and modular.

We then dynamically create and append property cards to the property container. Each card includes the property title and an image. We also call the showDetails function to add more details based on user permissions.

Next, we have a function to add review cards to the review container. It displays the top two reviews when the button is clicked, and then removes the button to prevent adding them again

In the footer, we display the current location, date, and temperature. We also create a MainProperty class to encapsulate the details of a main property, and then we instantiate it with an example property and add its image to the main image container.

So, to summarize, this TypeScript code dynamically generates a user interface for property reviews and listings. We've seen how data is structured using interfaces, how DOM manipulation is handled to display properties and reviews, and how user interactions are managed with event listeners. This modular approach makes the code easy to maintain and extend.
